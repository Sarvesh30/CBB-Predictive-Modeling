# CBB-Predictive-Modeling

Loaded and cleaned/manipulated the CBB dataset from Kaggle (link provided below). Various simple linear regression models were trained and tested to predict team win percentages. The models were used to create a composite score to determine the top 25 teams for the next year and decade. Currently working on introducing feature engineering (injuries, recruiting, transfer portal) to enhance the prediction and rankings.
